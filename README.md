# Dockerized OpenTOSCA Environment

> Docker files for running the entire OpenTOSCA stack.

The fastest way to get started is using [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/):

    git clone https://github.com/OpenTOSCA/opentosca-dockerfiles.git && cd opentosca-dockerfiles
    docker-compose build
    docker-compose up

Wait a few seconds, then open:

    http://<HOST>:8080

Have fun!
